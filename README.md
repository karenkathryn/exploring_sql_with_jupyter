# Exploring SQL in Jupyter

This repository houses code that displays examples of using SQL to query a database in a Jupyter Notebook. 

This README.md file will serve as a roadmap to this repository. The repository is open and available to the public.

### Directories and files to be aware of:
* A data/ directory that houses code to generate a database with astronomy facts in multiple relational tables.
* A notebooks/ directory that houses a Jupyter Notebook which has code to query the tables.

### Results
You can read about exploring SQL with astronomy examples in the blog posts listed in the Results section of [this](https://github.com/karenkathryn/exploring_sql) repository's main README.md file. All the code in these blog posts was generated in the terminal. The _Exploring SQL in Jupyter_ project explores how to utilize the queries in a Jupyter Notebook.
